		<th>How we addressed the challenge:</th>
		<td>For Master Chief, we attempted a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel">mecanum</a> wheel system for the first time. We designed a forklift to easily bring the inner tubes from ground level to the top peg in seconds. Team 691 made “the claw” to grab the inner tubes which had simple rollers to grab the tubes and hold them in with 45 pounds of force. Our “mini-bot,” Cortana, could climb the pole in less than 4 seconds.</td>

		<th>Unique robot features:</th>
		<td>
			• 4 wheel independent suspension
			</br>
			• Forklift that can go from ground level to the top rack in less than 10 seconds
			</br>
			• Extraordinarily fast robot
		</td>

		<th>Results:</th>
		<td>Master Chief is almost certainly the best performing robot that Team 691 has ever built. It made the playoffs in the first competition and consistently scored 5 inner tubes in the second, easily making it one of the top 5 scoring robots in that competition.</td>
