		<th>How we addressed the challenge:</th>
		<td>Doom used our tried and tested <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel">mecanum</a> wheel system. Doom’s Frisbee shooting mechanism works similar to a pitching machine that has been turned onto its side. In order to shoot from multiple locations, the shooter can tilt up and down. In order to allow Doom to ascend to the first level of the pyramid, the turret tilt had 250 foot pounds of torque in order to lift the entire robot onto the pyramid.</td>

		<th>Results:</th>
		<td>Most notable of Doom's failures was self-inflicted destruction at the hands of its overly powerful shooter tilt. However, it proved its ability on defence, at one point it even pushed two robots at once. It was also capable of consistently scoring in autonomous.</td>
