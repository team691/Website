		<th>How we addressed the challenge:</th>
		<td>Blue Bot has a four wheel design. It picks up balls from the floor with ease due to its conveyor belt. It drops these balls off at the shooter for a quick shot into the opposing team's trailers. Also, its heavy weight made it a bully on the field.</td>
