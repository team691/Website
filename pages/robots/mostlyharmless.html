		<th>How we addressed the challenge:</th>
		<td> Mostly Harmless used our mecanum wheel system. It has an arm on the front that uses the robot’s weight to push down the bridge. Also, Mostly Harmless had a target tracking system that used hand coded image recognition software to center the basketball hoops in the camera and thusly the shooter. Once it is centered, it determines the distance from the hoops. In order to process this information, a separate computer running Linux is on the robot. The only thing the driver must do is tell the robot to take the shot. The shooter itself works almost exactly like a baseball pitching machine. </td>
