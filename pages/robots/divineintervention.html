		<th>How we addressed the challenge:</th>
		<td>Divine Intervention had an eight wheel drive with pneumatically articulated wheels to easily pass over the bumps without tipping. Our soccer ball kicking mechanism was powered by surgical tubing. In order to climb the tower, the robot raised on its active suspension, a hook activated pneumatically and grabbed onto the tower. The hook then lowered, raising the robot.</td>

		<th>Results:</th>
		<td>Divine Intervention was a great defending robot due to its high weight and impressive speed. Our active suspension amazed onlookers. Sadly, our robot’s tower climbing mechanism was rarely used in competition.</td>
