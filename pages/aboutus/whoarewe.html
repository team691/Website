<strong>Who We Are</strong>
</p>
Project 691 is a student-lead mentor-guided team of high school students that annually compete in the First Robotics Competition. In the competition, students from different high schools around the world face off against one another in a sport-like event that changes each year. Project 691 strives to give students the tools they need to succeed in their future careers. Going beyond mechanical engineering, we teach programming, business, marketing, and  electronics.
