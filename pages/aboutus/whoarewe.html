<strong>Who Are We</strong>
</p>
Project 691 is a student lead mentor guided team of High school students that annually compete in the First Robotics Competition. In the Competition, students from different high schools around the world are faced off against each other in a sport like event that changes every year. Project 691 strives to giving students the tools they need to succeed in their future careers. Going beyond mechanical engineering, we teach programming, business, marketing, and  electronics.
